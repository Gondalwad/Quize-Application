# Quiz Application üìö

Hello! üëã  
This is my Quiz App I build using Spring Boot with H2 database. This app is created as part of challange organized by Verto Pune.

This application is currently enough to conduct online quizzes but it is not secure currently.

I have followed good package structure to build this apis. 
Maintinating separation of concern and implemented `Single Responsibility Principle`

## üìÅ Project Structure

I try to separate logics in packages. Below is the packages and what they do:

- `controller` ‚Äì This has all rest api endpoints. Like `/createQuiz`, `/addQuestions`, etc.
- `dto` ‚Äì These are data transfer objects. I use them in request and response to send limited and clean data.
- `exception` ‚Äì For handling error cases like quiz not found, bad request, etc.
- `mapper` ‚Äì I made simple mappers to convert model to DTO and back.
- `model` ‚Äì It has my entity classes which save data in database.
- `repo` ‚Äì It has interfaces that connect with database using Spring Data JPA.
- `service` ‚Äì Here I write main business logics like save quiz, validate answers, etc.
